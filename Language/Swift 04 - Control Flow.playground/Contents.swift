This makes the switch statement safer and easier to use than the one in C and avoids executing more than one switch case by mistake.

/// The break statement ends execution of an entire control flow statement immediately. The break statement can be used inside a switch or loop statement when you want to terminate the execution of the switch or loop statement earlier than would otherwise be the case.

//MARK: Fallthrough
/// In Swift, switch statements don’t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one. That is, the entire switch statement completes its execution as soon as the first matching case is completed. By contrast, C requires you to insert an explicit break statement at the end of every switch case to prevent fallthrough. Avoiding default fallthrough means that Swift switch statements are much more concise and predictable than their counterparts in C, and thus they avoid executing multiple switch cases by mistake.

//MARK: - Labeled Statements
/// In Swift, you can nest loops and conditional statements inside other loops and conditional statements to create complex control flow structures. However, loops and conditional statements can both use the break statement to end their execution prematurely. Therefore, it’s sometimes useful to be explicit about which loop or conditional statement you want a break statement to terminate. Similarly, if you have multiple nested loops, it can be useful to be explicit about which loop the continue statement should affect. To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement with a statement label. With a conditional statement, you can use a statement label with the break statement to end the execution of the labeled statement. With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the break or continue statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement.
